Description: This package gives methods for constructing a composite variable (a linear combination of pre-treatment patient characteristics) in order to generate an optimal treatment effect modifier in a linear model setting. The optimal linear combination is called a Generated Effect Modifier (GEM). Treatment is assumed to have been assigned at random. See more detail in E Petkova, T Tarpey, Z Su, and RT Ogden.
