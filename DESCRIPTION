Description: An implementation of the generated effect modifier (GEM) method. This method constructs composite variables by linearly combining pre-treatment scalar patient characteristics to create optimal treatment effect modifiers in linear models. The optimal linear combination is called a GEM. Treatment is assumed to have been assigned at random. For reference, see E Petkova, T Tarpey, Z Su, and RT Ogden.
